# Computer Vision Rock Paper Scissors Project

## Milestone 1

To create the model we used [Teachable-Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com), where we defined four classes: rock, paper, scissors and nothing. Any model will be most accurate when it is trained with large amounts of data, hence, a lot of pictures were taken for each class so the model is able to differentiate between these classes as accurately as possible.
